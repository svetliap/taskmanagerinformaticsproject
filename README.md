# ./taskmanagerinformaticsproject
## Overview
This Java application helps users manage tasks efficiently by providing functionalities to add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, delete tasks, and generate reports. The project is organized into three main files: `Main.java`, `Task.java`, and `TaskManager.java`.

- **Task.java**: Defines the `Task` class with attributes such as `taskId`, `description`, `dueDate`, `priority`, and `completed`, along with methods to manipulate these attributes.
- **TaskManager.java**: Implements the `TaskManager` class, which uses arrays to store and manage `Task` instances. It includes methods to add tasks, mark them as completed, delete tasks, and generate reports.
- **Main.java**: Provides a user-friendly console interface to interact with the task manager. It displays menu options, prompts users for input, and handles interactions effectively.

Together, these files create a comprehensive task management system that follows object-oriented principles and ensures proper encapsulation and scope management.
